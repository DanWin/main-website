"Stereotypically a sugar daddy is a wealthy older man, who's looking for an "

"relationship is a mutually beneficial relationship. Unlike traditional "

"for a few hours a month. An arrangement can also include sexual favours, "
"which are often asked for by men. However, this must be consensual, and if "
"you as a sugar baby do not feel comfortable with it, then you shouldn't do "
"it. Think about your priorities, what you need and what you could give to "

"Findom, short for financial domination. It is a fetish in which a dominant "
"person (dom) receives money from a submissive person (sub). This transaction "
"provides pleasure to both parties, even though it is a one-way transaction."

"For a sub, engaging in findom carries the risk of losing money and control. "
"It can become addictive and lead to overspending, financial instability or "
"homelessness. For a dom an unhealthy relationship with money could form, "
"given that they receive potentially a lot of it, and are tempted to spend "
"all of it. Once a sub no longer spends money on the dom, this could lead to "
"an existential crisis due to high expenses that need to be maintained."

"Findom relationships come in various forms. Some are short-lived, one-time "
"transactions, while others can span many years. While findom is purely "
"financial, it is also often combined with BDSM, content creation and other "
"erotic services. Some subs enjoy paying for online shopping or buying over-"
"priced feet pictures, others will go shopping with their dom in real life, "
"and some would like to be humiliated in public. A scenario could involve a "
"debt contract, in which the sub commits to paying off a debt to their dom "
"for an extended period in monthly instalments."

"Everyone is unique, so your specific needs need to be discussed with your "
"findom partner. It is important that both of you are happy with it. While "
"some subs and doms favour a fast one-time transaction, it is usually best "
"for both parties, if a long-term relationship can be established. To "
"maintain a healthy relationship, the dom needs to know a subs financial "
"situation, including income, expenses and spending habits. This knowledge "
"allows the dom to help the sub reduce expenses, increase income and "
"ultimately hand over more cash to the dom, without risking serious debt "
"problems. While it is an entertaining thought to some subs, ending up "
"homeless is not beneficial to anyone."
