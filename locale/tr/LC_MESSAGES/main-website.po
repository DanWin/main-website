"Just like with regular dating, you should be comfortable around your partner "

"it will ruin the experience for both of you, so you should better end it "
"sooner than later. Coming out as a sugar daddy or sugar baby can be "
"difficult as some people still think of it negatively and will criticise you "
"for it. It's also possible that as a provider you feel cheated of your money "
"at a later point in time, or as a sugar baby you could feel sexually "
"exploited if you agreed to sex just because of the money. That's why it's so "

"As sugar dating is mutually beneficial, both parties involved get something "
"out of it. There will be no drama, and by discussing each of your needs and "
"expectations, you avoid running into conflicts. It can be fun, and you will "
"see things from a different perspective than you are used to. Unlike "
"traditional dating, you don't have to spend significant time on a dating "
"site, until you match with someone interesting. It can take only a few hours "
"or days until you have found someone that matches you. Especially for men, "
"it is so much easier to find a date, than on regular dating sites, simply "
"because of the women-to-men ratio, plus women are less selective than on "
"regular dating sites, given that the type of relationship is mutually "
"beneficial and not necessarily romantic."

"You can potentially find your sugar partner on regular dating sites, but it "
"will be difficult due to most dating sites restricting this type of dating "
"and banning your accounts for using certain keywords. There are plenty of "
"dating sites specifically made for sugar dating though. Usually, they are "
"free for the attractive member, but the wealthy member has to pay to use the "
"platform. This way the platform also filters out so-called salt daddies, who "
"pretend to have money but do not."
